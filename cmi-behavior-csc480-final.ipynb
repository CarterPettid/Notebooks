    "\n",
    "1. **Orientation-robust IMU feature design**  \n",
    "   - Instead of using raw `(acc_x, acc_y, acc_z)` and `(gyro_x, gyro_y, gyro_z)` directly, we build\n",
    "     magnitude channels (`acc_mag`, `gyro_mag`) and extract statistics from them.  \n",
    "   - This reduces sensitivity to arbitrary arm orientation and focuses on movement intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multi-window temporal summarization of sequences**  \n",
    "   - Rather than summarizing each sequence with a single global statistic, we compute features over\n",
    "     multiple overlapping windows (full sequence, early half, late half).  \n",
    "   - This captures how behavior evolves within a sequence (onset vs offset), which is particularly\n",
    "     relevant to differentiating similar gestures.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Subject-aware model selection with a custom competition metric**  \n",
    "   - We implement a local approximation of the competition’s metric (binary F1 for Target vs\n",
    "     Non-Target plus macro F1 over collapsed gestures) and use it **inside a subject-aware CV loop**\n",
    "     (`StratifiedGroupKFold` / `GroupKFold`) for model selection.  \n",
    "   - This is stricter and more realistic than random CV, and directly aligned with how the Kaggle\n",
    "     leaderboard is scored.\n",
